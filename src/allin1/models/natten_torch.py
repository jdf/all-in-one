"""Neighborhood attention in plain PyTorch operations.

NATTEN ships CUDA kernels and a naive CPU kernel. This module provides the four
functions that `dinat.py` takes from `natten.functional`, written with indexing
and einsum only, so that the model also runs where NATTEN has no kernel (Apple's
MPS backend) or is not installed, and runs faster on the CPU than the naive
kernel does. The operations are differentiable, so autograd provides the
backward pass.

The window and relative-position-bias index rules follow NATTEN's
csrc/include/natten/cpu/naive/natten_cpu_commons.h.
